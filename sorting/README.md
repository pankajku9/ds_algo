# Sorting Algorithm 
This is an implementation of these sorting algoritham in C and a simple test framework to run performence test.
* bubble sort
* selection sort
* insertion sort
* merge sort
* quick sort
* heap sort
* btree sort
* counting sort



##  Analysis of performence of sorting algoritham. 
The chart is plotted against logrithmic scale and time in microsec.

#### Observations
1. bubble sort and slection sort have worst case perfomence.
2. Insertion sort and merge sort have similar performence.
3. Heap Sort and btree sort is similar performnece i.e. O(nlogn)
4. Quick sort performs better on other comparistion based sorter on random data set.
5. Counting Sort performs better but have space requirements.
## Todo
1. Add more algo such as radix sort etc
2. Add parllel sorting algos
